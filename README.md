# Todo-App
A command-line-based To-Do Task Management system built using Python. This system allows users to:

Add tasks to the to-do list.
View tasks with their current status.
Update the status of tasks to "complete".
Visualize the task completion status with a bar chart.
The application uses basic Python features such as lists, loops, and conditional statements for task management. It also includes data visualization using matplotlib.
